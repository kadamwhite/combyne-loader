# [Combyne](https://github.com/tbranyen/combyne) loader for [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org)

Loads and compiles templates using the [Combyne](https://github.com/tbranyen/combyne) template engine; very much a work-in-progress.

See the [Webpack documentation on using loaders](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/loaders/#using-loaders) for more information.
